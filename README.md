#Rough description

We are proposing the design of a flexion-activated glove to produce sound and possibly light. The MIDI glove will play a different note upon the flexion of each separate finger on the user’s hand, as well as possibly provide a visual indication with LEDs.

In terms of materials (apart from the Arduino Uno), our project includes the use of flex sensors, a speaker, and gloves. At this point, we have ordered five 2.2” flex sensors and are planning on using the speaker on the DangerShield, as well as procuring some gloves from Target.

The idea behind this project comes from an ongoing project called MiMu gloves, which is the development of a type of musical gloves that can be used to not only play sounds but also modify and alter them on stage. While we are not seeking to emulate these gloves, we took the concept of musical gloves and are going to create our own simpler version.

For our first prototype, we expect to have a glove with flex sensors that can play a different note when each finger is bent. From here, we can add layers of complexity by adding the following potential functions or improvements: 

#Future Improvements
Hand orientation affects the notes being played (reverb, volume, etc)

Ability to change octaves

Flashing LEDs

Playing multiple notes at once (might need multiple speakers)

Make the whole system portable
