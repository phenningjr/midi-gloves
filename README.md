#Abstract
Inspired by MiMu gloves, a type of glove that can not only play sounds but also modify and alter them onstage, our Music Bender Glove will allow us to control music with our hands. The Music Bender Glove, or MBG, will use flexion sensors as triggers to play musical notes. As the user bends his or her fingers while wearing the glove, different notes will play, each corresponding to one finger. Once the user passes a certain degree of bending threshold, the program will register that the finger is indeed bent and play a note. However, for our initial prototype only one note will be played at any one time. Additionally, the user will be able to adjust the pitch of the note using sliders. To construct this we will use five 2.2” flex sensors, a glove, an Arduino Uno, and a DangerShield. For future improvements, we could add the interface of hand orientation using a gyro or accelerometer, as well as the ability to play multiple notes at once. 

#Rough description

We are proposing the design of a flexion-activated glove to produce sound and possibly light. The MIDI glove will play a different note upon the flexion of each separate finger on the user’s hand, as well as possibly provide a visual indication with LEDs.

In terms of materials (apart from the Arduino Uno), our project includes the use of flex sensors, a speaker, and gloves. At this point, we have ordered five 2.2” flex sensors and are planning on using the speaker on the DangerShield, as well as procuring some gloves from Target.

The idea behind this project comes from an ongoing project called MiMu gloves, which is the development of a type of musical gloves that can be used to not only play sounds but also modify and alter them on stage. While we are not seeking to emulate these gloves, we took the concept of musical gloves and are going to create our own simpler version.

For our first prototype, we expect to have a glove with flex sensors that can play a different note when each finger is bent. From here, we can add layers of complexity by adding the following potential functions or improvements: 

#Future Improvements
Hand orientation affects the notes being played (reverb, volume, etc)

Ability to change octaves

Flashing LEDs

Playing multiple notes at once (might need multiple speakers)

Make the whole system portable
